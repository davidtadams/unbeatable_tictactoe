TODO:
  - add timeout to try and fake AI thinking ??
  - clean up code
    - general cleanup and refactor
    - refactor minimax algorithm
    - avoid global namespaced code
  - add different levels of AI easy, medium, hard
  - redo styling
    maybe use flexbox and/or grid?

Minimax algorithm
  - return a value if a terminal state is found (+10, 0, -10)
  - go through available spots on the board
  - call the minimax function on each available spot (recursively)
  - evaluate returning values from function calls
  - retuns the best value
